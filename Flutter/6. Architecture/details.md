# Clean Architecture vs Hybrid Modular Approach Folder Structure

This document provides a recommended folder structure for implementing Clean Architecture in a Flutter application. Clean Architecture helps maintain separation of concerns, making code easier to test, maintain, and scale.

# Hybrid Modular Approach vs. Clean Architecture

| **Aspect**              | **Hybrid Modular Approach**                              | **Clean Architecture**                       |
|-------------------------|----------------------------------------------------------|----------------------------------------------|
| **Primary Focus**       | Modular organization by feature or functional components | Separation of concerns, clear dependency rules |
| **Structure**           | Feature/function-based folders (e.g., screens, data, util) | Layer-based folders (e.g., data, domain, presentation) |
| **Dependencies**        | Allows flexibility, modules can reference each other freely | Inner layers can’t depend on outer layers   |
| **Flexibility**         | High flexibility, adaptable for various app sizes        | Structured and rigid, suitable for large, scalable apps |
| **Best for**            | Small to medium apps, teams looking for quick navigation | Large apps, teams with strict requirements for maintainability |
| **Pros**                | - Easy navigation<br> - Quick to set up<br> - Great for smaller teams | - High maintainability<br> - Great for testing and scalability<br> - Clear layer boundaries |
| **Cons**                | - Risk of tangled dependencies as the app grows<br> - Limited structure for larger projects | - Complex setup for small projects<br> - Requires strict adherence to rules and structure |
