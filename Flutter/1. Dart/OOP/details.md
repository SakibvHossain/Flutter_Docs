## Abstract vs Concrete (Class, Method, Fields)
### Abstract
1. Class: A class without implementation.
2. Method: A method has no implementation `void method();` is an abstract method.
3. Fields: Abstract fileds can be created via getters and setters.

### Concrete
1. Class: A concrete class is a class that is fully implemented and can be instantiated.
2. Method: A method has implementation or has a body is called a concrete method.
3. Fields: A field occupies a memory or space is a concrete field no matter if it holds a null values it is still a concrete field.
  ```
   int count; //Concrete field
   late int count; //Not a Concrete field
  ```
